/**
 * Tracks the phone's Bluetooth SCO (hands-free audio) link on behalf of the
 * app and decides what to do with {@code AudioManager} at each step. Pure
 * logic — no Android calls — so the whole state machine is unit-testable.
 *
 * <p>Why this exists (issue #759, Android 8.x Bluetooth RX dead): the app used
 * to fire {@code stopBluetoothSco(); startBluetoothSco();} blindly on every
 * "turn Bluetooth on" event, and several of those fire back-to-back at launch
 * (headset-mode gate, rig connect, profile-connected broadcast). Stopping a
 * request that is still CONNECTING abandons the half-built link in the
 * Bluetooth stack — on Oreo the stale virtual call then makes every later
 * start a silent no-op ("Call in progress"). The
 * {@code ACTION_SCO_AUDIO_STATE_UPDATED} broadcast was registered but never
 * handled, so a failed or dropped link was never retried, nothing was logged,
 * and the {@code AudioRecord} created before SCO came up was never re-created
 * once it did (Android's documented recipe is "start recording after
 * SCO_AUDIO_STATE_CONNECTED").
 *
 * <p>Rules encoded here:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A request to turn SCO on while it is already CONNECTING/CONNECTED is a
 *       no-op — never restart a link that is being built.</li>
 *   <li>{@code startBluetoothSco()} is reference-counted per client in
 *       AudioService, and a start that ends in DISCONNECTED/ERROR can leave the
 *       count at 1, where a second bare start does nothing. Every retry is
 *       therefore a stop+start ({@link Action#RESTART}).</li>
 *   <li>Retries are bounded ({@link #MAX_ATTEMPTS}) and spaced
 *       ({@link #retryDelayMs}); a link that stayed up for
 *       {@link #STABLE_LINK_MS} earns a fresh budget when it drops.</li>
 *   <li>A start that never reports CONNECTED within
 *       {@link #CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS} counts as failed.</li>
 *   <li>Once CONNECTED, the mic must actually be capturing from the SCO device;
 *       if the OS did not re-route the existing AudioRecord, re-create it
 *       ({@link #needsMicReinit}).</li>
 * </ul>
