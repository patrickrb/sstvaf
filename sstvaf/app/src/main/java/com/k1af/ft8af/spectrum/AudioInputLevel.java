/**
 * Pure audio input-level metering for the receive level indicator.
 *
 * <p>A user comparing the app to WSJT-X often has the radio's USB audio set too quiet (weak
 * signals fall below the decode threshold) or hot enough to clip (intermodulation wrecks the
 * decode). Unlike WSJT-X the app gave no level feedback, so the gain was set blind. This turns
 * a raw 12&nbsp;kHz mono float buffer (samples in roughly [-1, 1]) into a peak/RMS reading plus
 * a coarse {@link Status} the UI can colour, so the operator can set gain the way WSJT-X's
 * meter lets them.
 *
 * <p>All thresholds are expressed in dBFS (decibels relative to full scale, so 0&nbsp;dB is a
 * sample magnitude of 1.0 and every value here is &le; 0). Clipping is judged from the peak;
 * "too quiet" from the RMS, which tracks the noise/signal energy rather than a lone spike.
 *
 * <p>This is deliberately a plain class with a static entry point so it is unit-testable
 * without Android; the fragment is a thin wrapper that maps {@link Status} to a colour.
