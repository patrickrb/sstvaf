/**
 * Decides how {@link CableConnector} reacts when the CAT / serial read loop
 * reports an error, so a single-packet glitch (marginal connector, cheap OTG
 * hub, RFI into the cable during TX) no longer drops the whole session and
 * strands the user on the manual <em>"tap to retry"</em> chip.
 *
 * <p>Pure logic, no Android types — unit-tested. {@link CableConnector} stays a
 * thin wrapper that consults these helpers, matching
 * {@link com.k1af.ft8af.wave.UsbCaptureRetryPolicy} on the audio side.
 *
 * <p>Two questions:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Is the error transient or fatal?</b> Most serial read-loop
 *       {@link Exception}s are a brief I/O stall the device recovers from by
 *       re-enumerating with the same VID/PID. Only a message that names the
 *       device as genuinely gone or access-denied is fatal.</li>
 *   <li><b>Should we auto-reconnect, and after how long?</b> A transient error
 *       retries indefinitely with exponential backoff, escalating to
 *       {@link #MAX_BACKOFF_MS} and staying there — containment comes from the
 *       interval, not from giving up. A single glitch is absorbed silently. Only a
 *       FATAL classification surfaces the manual retry state.</li>
 * </ol>
