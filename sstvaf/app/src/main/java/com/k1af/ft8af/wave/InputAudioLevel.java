/**
 * RX input gain + input-level metering (issue #356).
 *
 * <p>{@link #applyGain} multiplies incoming float samples by the user's
 * configured input volume before they reach the resampler / slot accumulator /
 * decoder. It is called from {@link HamRecorder#doOnWaveDataReceived}, the
 * single choke point every RX audio path funnels through (built-in mic
 * AudioRecord, direct-USB capture, and the network-audio connectors), so the
 * decoder, the waterfall FFT, and the level meter all see the same post-gain
 * samples.
 *
 * <p>The instance side is a short-sliding-window level meter: it accumulates
 * peak (max absolute sample) and sum-of-squares over {@link #WINDOW_SAMPLES}
 * post-gain samples and emits one {@link Levels} snapshot per completed
 * window (~4 per second at 12 kHz), which the caller posts to LiveData for
 * the Compose UI. Emitting once per window instead of once per audio buffer
 * keeps main-thread traffic bounded regardless of capture buffer size.
 *
 * <p>Plain Java with no Android dependencies so it is unit-testable on the
 * host JVM.
