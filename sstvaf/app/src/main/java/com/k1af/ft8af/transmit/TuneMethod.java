 * Tune method setting (issue #425): what the TUNE chip does when tapped.

 *   <li>{@link #AUTOMATIC} — use the rig's internal ATU when a CAT rig whose
 *       protocol has an ATU-start command is connected; otherwise fall back
 *       to the low-power carrier tone.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #INTERNAL} — always use the rig's internal ATU; if none is
 *       available, do nothing but tell the operator (no surprise carrier).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #TONE} — always the low-power carrier tone (pre-#425 behavior).</li>

 * ATU capability can't be queried over CAT, so "available" only means the
 * protocol defines the command; rigs without an ATU ignore it harmlessly.
