/**
 * Rate limiting for {@code MainViewModel.setOperationBand()} — the CAT retune that pushes
 * the app's dial and USB mode to the rig.
 *
 * <p>Motivating data (2026-07-30 POTA activation, from {@code debug.log}): {@code
 * setOperationBand()} ran in a continuous ~1 Hz loop for the ENTIRE session, re-sending
 * {@code FA014074000; MD0C; NA00;SH0117;} about 57 times a minute to a rig that was
 * already on that exact frequency and mode — {@code rig.getFreq} matched the target on
 * every single iteration. 20,124 occurrences across the pulled log, present in every POTA
 * session in it.
 *
 * <p><strong>This is containment, not a root-cause fix.</strong> The caller driving that
 * loop has not been identified. It is provably not the connect path (only 11 autoConnect
 * attempts in the whole window, and no connect/disconnect churn logged), not a band change
 * (no {@code bandSelect:} lines), and not self-triggering through {@code onFreqChanged}
 * ({@code BaseRig.setFreq} early-returns on an unchanged dial, and the dial never changed).
 * Two independent ~1.05 s series interleave about 0.53 s apart, one always observing the
 * rig connected and one always observing it disconnected, which suggests duplicated
 * observers or two live view-model instances rather than one runaway timer.
 *
 * <p>So this class does two things: makes the retune idempotent so the spam stops whatever
 * the caller turns out to be, and gives {@code setOperationBand()} a rate-limited
 * suppression log that names the caller — so the next activation's {@code debug.log}
 * identifies the culprit instead of leaving it to inference.

     *
     * <p>Resetting on every {@code onConnected()} looked right — a new link genuinely is a
     * new session — but the 2026-07-31 activation showed that callback IS the runaway. The
     * suppression log named it directly:
     * {@code caller=com.k1af.ft8af.MainViewModel$1$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0.run:0}, i.e.
     * the {@code MainViewModel.this::setOperationBand} posted from {@code onConnected()}.
     * {@code CableSerialPort} fires that callback on every successful port {@code open()},
     * and the port was re-opening about once a second, so the reset re-armed the limiter on
     * every iteration of the loop it exists to contain — retunes went UP, to 73/min from
     * the 57/min measured before the rate limit existed.
     *
     * <p>Debouncing distinguishes the two cases without needing to know why the port
     * churns: a burst of connects seconds apart is one flapping link and must not re-arm
     * anything, while a reconnect after a real outage is minutes later and should. The
     * underlying re-open storm is a separate bug still to be fixed.
