/**
 * Chunked, phase-continuous single-tone generator for the Tune function
 * (issue #408): a pure sinusoid at the TX audio offset, held for as long as
 * the operator tunes, with a raised-cosine ramp at start and stop so keying
 * never clicks/splatters.
 *
 * <p>Unlike the FT8 waveform (generated whole by the native library), the tune
 * tone is open-ended, so it is produced in short chunks; the caller polls
 * "still tuning?" between chunks and requests the final ramp-down via
 * {@link #requestStop()}. The phase accumulator carries across chunks, so
 * there is no discontinuity at chunk boundaries.
 *
 * <p>Pure arithmetic with injected frequency/sample-rate/amplitude — no
 * Android, no native code — so it is deterministic and unit-testable
 * (CLAUDE.md testing rule).
