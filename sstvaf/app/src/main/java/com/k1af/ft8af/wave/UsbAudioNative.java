/**
 * JNI bridge to {@code libsstvaf.so}: libusb-backed USB Audio Class
 * isochronous capture.
 *
 * <p>The Java side ({@link UsbAudioDevice}) opens the device, claims the
 * audio streaming interface, finds the iso input endpoint, and sets the
 * alt-setting (which is what actually starts the audio stream) using the
 * stock Android {@code UsbManager} APIs. It then hands the resulting
 * file descriptor + interface parameters to {@link #nativeStart} here.
 * Native runs the iso transfers via libusb and calls back into Java with
 * mono float samples at the target sample rate.
 *
 * <p>We do this instead of using {@link android.hardware.usb.UsbRequest}
 * because that API's iso path silently fails on some kernels — notably
 * the car-dash Android 11 tablets — throwing
 * {@code IllegalStateException: request is not initialized} on first
 * {@code queue()}.
