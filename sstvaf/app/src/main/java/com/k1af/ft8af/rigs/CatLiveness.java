/**
 * Pure decision logic for the CAT connection liveness watchdog, kept separate from
 * MainViewModel so it can be unit-tested without Android.
 *
 * <p>The problem it solves: a Bluetooth (or other) CAT link can stay "connected" at the
 * transport level after the radio itself is powered off — the BT module keeps the socket
 * up, so no I/O error ever fires and the status chip stays green while frequency writes
 * silently go nowhere. The watchdog actively probes the rig (a periodic frequency read) and
 * watches for replies; if the rig has gone quiet for too long it flips the chip to error.
 *
 * <p>Two guards keep it from crying wolf:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>It never judges during transmit (we don't poll while keyed).</li>
 *   <li>The <em>stale</em> decision only arms once the rig has answered at least once since
 *       connecting ({@code sawResponse}). Probes are still sent every tick (see
 *       {@link #shouldProbe}); it's only the "declare dead" judgement that waits for a first
 *       reply, so a rig that never answers a frequency read (or a transport that doesn't
 *       support it) can't be falsely marked dead.</li>
 * </ul>
