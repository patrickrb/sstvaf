/**
 * The channel layout an {@code AudioTrack} transmit opens with, and the frame
 * arithmetic that has to follow it.
 *
 * <p>Shared by the FT8/FT4 over ({@code playViaAudioTrack}) and the Tune
 * carrier ({@code playTuneTone}) so both honour the operator's TX channel
 * selection the same way — a splitter cable that only wants one rig keyed is
 * just as wrong keying the other rig with a tune carrier as with an over.
 *
 * <p>Two things live here rather than inline because getting them wrong
 * produces a transmission that sounds fine and decodes nowhere:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code AudioTrack.write()} counts <em>samples</em> and
 *       {@code getPlaybackHeadPosition()} counts <em>frames</em>. The tail-drain
 *       wait compares the two, so every count crossing that boundary goes
 *       through {@link #framesFromSamples}.
 *   <li>The byte budget for the ~200 ms streaming buffer must scale with the
 *       channel count or a stereo open only holds ~100 ms and blocks on every
 *       chunk.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The mono layout is the historical one and is left byte-for-byte alone:
 * {@link #layOut} hands the caller's buffer straight back, the pad is 8 shorts,
 * and the buffer budget is what it always was. Only an explicit Left/Right on a
 * sink we can actually see takes the stereo branch — see {@link #resolve}.
