/**
 * JNI bridge to hamlib, hosted inside {@code libsstvaf.so}.
 *
 * <p>hamlib owns the per-radio CAT protocol; the app owns the byte transport
 * (its existing USB-serial {@code CableSerialPort}). Native code presents each
 * rig to hamlib as a loopback-TCP "network" port and bridges that socket to
 * Java: bytes hamlib wants to send to the radio arrive via
 * {@link HamlibSink#onBytesToRig(byte[])}, and bytes the radio sends back are
 * pushed in via {@link #feedFromRig(long, byte[])}. See
 * {@code cpp/ft8af_glue/hamlib_jni.cpp} and {@code cpp/hamlib/HAMLIB_PIN.txt}.
 *
 * <p>All {@code native} calls except {@link #feedFromRig} are synchronous CAT
 * round-trips and must be invoked off the UI thread and off the serial read
 * thread (that thread delivers {@link #feedFromRig}); {@code HamlibRig} runs
 * them on its own single worker.
