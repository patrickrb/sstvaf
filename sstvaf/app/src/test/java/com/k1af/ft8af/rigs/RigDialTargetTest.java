 * <p>Reported as "it takes a loooong time for the radio to change frequencies". Measured:
 * the command itself was dispatched in 815 ms, but the rig rejected it ("?;", 29 times that
 * session), reported a frequency nobody had asked for, and the app then commanded that
 * value back — so a 30m selection took ~59 s and four taps to stick.
